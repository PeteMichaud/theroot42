== The Root Forum

No categories

No threads

Comments have tags

Any user can tag any comment (data saved about who tagged it as what)

Navigation shows top tags (as opposed to categories)

users can save their own favorite tags to be in their navigation

comments can be up and down voted, but it doesn't affect placement. Just forms a list of who likes and dislikes (publically visible)

commenting at the bottom of the "thread" of tagged posts will add a comment with the same tag transparently

There will be no custom styles (maybe a per user css override?), maybe a dark and a light theme though

comments are infinitely loaded (no pages)

comments support root flavored bbcode

system should be smart enough to know who started a "thread" and who is the latest poster in it, and if there are unread posts

    user_tag_views: user_id, tag, viewed_at
    tag: tag, latest activity (time stamp of most recent comment with tag)

    cull user_tag_views every X days (30?)

threads have thumbnails based on first comment's included pictures

Users have:
    email
    password
    real name
    DOB
    location
    google maps link to location map
    profile
    account type (user, moderator, admin)
    avatar
    active?

Member list
    alphabetical by name
    alpha by email
    most recent activity? (can help filter out inactive users)

Invite System
    30 votes in 30 days gets the user invited
    invites have an inactive user attached that the inviter created, and a post attached with the #invite tag
    when it's upvoted/liked 30 times within 30 days, that triggers the invite e-mail to go out
    invite posts are prominantly/annoyingly displayed at the top of the forum until the person votes
    votes on those threads should be anonymous? maybe? or at least that post should be hidden from the invitee if that
    person is accepted

Private messages could be just comments? tagged with a username? and maybe a #private?

Chat. I totally want chat built into the site
    if I make the forum real time in terms of loading comments as they are posted via ajax, then maybe there could be no
    difference between "threads" and the chat. Maybe chat could be autotagged with the date?
